This code adds functionality to the steering wheel buttons of a mk7 Ford 
Fiesta with the audio package 1. With the correspondent hardware songs 
can be skipped and paused via the aux cord. Long pressing the prev button
launches the google assistant on android phones. 
Wiring diagrams and a PCB-design are in the repository.
A sleep mode may be added, but isn't necessary depending on the power
source and due to the low energy consumption of the ATtiny45.
Settings may need to be tweaked.
